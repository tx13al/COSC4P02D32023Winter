## Description
The Museum Assistance Application (MAA) was designed to provide users with an interactive map to help them navigate their way around the museum. It also aims to enhance their experience by providing them with information about the artefacts on display and also with ways to find out more about those artefacts. Lastly, this application was also designed to allow staff members to keep the map up to date from within the map allowing them to give visitors the most up-to-date information on the museum. 

## How to Install and Run
Clone the repository to your device and run using Android studio. We are all currently using the Electric Eel version to run ours. After loading it up in Android studio, we recommend using the Pixel 6 emulator with the API version 30. 

## How to Use
Please refer to the user manuals either on GitHub or within the application for how to use the application.
