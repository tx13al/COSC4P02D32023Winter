901.112,Sampler,"Fragile and ephemeral, cross-stitch samplers are among the few surviving artefacts of the domestic lives of young girls and women of the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries. As tangible evidence of their daily work, samplers offer a rare glimpse into the concerns and pursuits of our feminine ancestors. Unfortunately, their fragility and sensitivity to light also means they are seldom on display. The Niagara Historical Society has exhibited the samplers from its collection only three times in the past two decades.
This charming and well-balanced sampler, completed by Augusta Stewart at Niagara in March 1834, is one of 29 samplers in the Niagara Historical Society's permanent collection. It is stitched entirely in cross and Algerian eye stitches; its colours of muted green, tan and gold silk are most likely faded from their original, more vivid hues. Bounded with a regular green and gold border, it features three alphabets, two sets of numerals and ten decorative horizontal bands - some stitched over two threads of linen and some over one. There are two spot motifs: a fruit basket (symbol of fertility) and two evergreen trees (symbols of life). It is damaged in five places.
Little is known about Augusta Stewart - her age, her family, whether she remained in Niagara or whether she had any descendants.
The most charming thing about her sampler is the inclusion of two opening verses of the Isaac Watts poem praising the industriousness of bees. ""How skillfully she builds her cell,"" stitched young Augusta in her careful way - neatly demonstrating a prized nineteenth century feminine virtue.",1834,1834,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/32F68E17-9BB1-42AF-B2DD-441876154456,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/901112.jpg

969.104,Box:Carpenter's Tool,"John Swinton's tool box, which dates from the early 1800's, appears to have a dual purpose.  On the one hand, this apparently plain, wooden chest, painted black with rope handles at each end, was used as a container for his tools.  On the other hand, and perhaps more importantly, as one examines the interior, it becomes obvious that this man used the box as an example of his craftsmanship.  The owner's name is painted on the front and its condition is ""fair - good"".The underside of the lid is made of mahogany-coloured wood, which is cleverly inlaid with a delicate diamond pattern.  Inside the box, at the top, are two wooden trays lying lengthways along the back and along the front, with a space in the middle to provide access to several drawers. The aforementioned trays contain a series of drawers with white knobs and may be moved from front to back on metal channels attached to the interior of each end of the box.  Underneath these top trays is another set of trays, again  with drawers, and again one being in front and one at the back.  Altogether, there are fourteen drawers in the back units, nine in the lower and five in the upper.  As well, the top unit has a hinged lid to provide access to the top section.  The front units have fifteen drawers, nine in the lower, four in the upper and two small drawers, which may be seen at the lower right when the bottom front unit is moved toward the back into the empty space.In the bottom of the box and in the centre cavity are several tools.  These are as follows: two keyhole saws, one large-handled chisel device, one bow saw, two soldering irons, two squares, one axe, one wooden mallet, two two-handled shaving tools, one small claw hammer, one brass compass engraved with the date 1809 and the name, J. Robinson, one marking gauge, one large wooden plane and a set of ten routing planes, each with its own individual design for carving mouldings, cornices, etc.  The large wooden plane and the set of routing planes are all hand-made, most likely by Swinton.All in all, this artefact and its contents demonstrate that John Swinton was a true craftsman.",1800,1805,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/05A92F28-4658-4188-BE00-004519044620,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/008/thumbs/969104.jpg

969.125,Chair,"From 1781 until 1862 Niagara-on-the-Lake (known then as Newark or the Town of Niagara) was the legal centre of the Province of Upper Canada and of Lincoln and Welland County. As a result, there was a large legal community and many high profile cases that took place in town. Accommodating this civil service required a number of different court house buildings over the years, the first of which was burned to the ground by American forces in December of 1813. A replacement was built in 1817 and this chair was soon after brought in to serve as the bench for the presiding judge.One of the earliest neo-Gothic chairs in Ontario, this formal, black walnut chair with leather cushion remained in use when another courthouse was built on Queen Street in 1847. Niagara would lose most of its legal significance in 1862 when the county court was relocated to St. Catharines, with the court house thereafter being used as the Town Hall. A fixture of the building by then, mayors of Niagara used the chair in council meetings until at least 1877, as the chair can be spotted in an 1877 painting of the Hall's interior in the collection of the Toronto Public Library.",1820,1830,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/98AC5060-D33D-46AA-9762-492855366769,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/thumbs/969125-2.jpg

970.143,Shell Money:Wampum,"Wampum beads were manufactured by the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people through a difficult and painstaking process through which small, smooth, cylindrical beads were created out of shell.  The word ""wampum"" is derived from the Algonkian word ""wampumpeag."" The beads vary in colour, from white to a dark purple-black, and each colour had a certain value attached to it, with the darker colours being more valuable.  Along with the Haudenosaunee, other nations, largely those along the Northern Atlantic coast, manufactured and used wampum.  Contrary to popular belief, wampum was not used by the Haudenosaunee as a direct form of currency, but rather as a means of exchange or barter.  The beads had many other varied uses, including as a gift, given upon the negotiation of treaties, as a burnt offering upon the death of an individual, as an invitation to council, or even given to the family of a murder victim, as a compensation for the slaying.  Wampum belts, which consist of many beads of varying colour strung together to form often complex patterns were an important diplomatic tool among native peoples and acted like modern day treaties.

970.931,Coin,"Nowhere in British North America did the private copper tokens issued by merchants and others have a more fascinating evolutionary history than in Lower Canada - now Quebec. In the 1820s and 1830s, trade in Montreal, the colony's commercial centre, created a strong demand for coinage. As coins were often in short supply, privately produced tokens filled the void. Tokens were not legal tender and their circulation was against the law. However, this was little deterrent at a time when legal coins were scarce. The first private coppers were heavy pieces, about the same weight as the penny and halfpenny coins they supplemented.However, by the 1830s the tokens were barely half the weight of the official coins and, at times, were so numerous that people would no longer accept them. Various tricks were therefore resorted to in order to make their circulation possible. One interesting approach was to copy the designs of tokens that had previously been of heavy weight and had enjoyed wide circulation. About 1832 a Montreal grocer named Tiffin issued copper halfpenny tokens. They bore the date 1812 and were imitations of much heavier pieces produced twenty years earlier. The obverse carried a bust of King George III surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves and acorns and the figure of a seated woman representing Commerce was the design on the reverse.

Brock was killed on 13 October 1812 during an attack by invading U.S. forces at Queenston Heights on the Niagara frontier. During the war, private tokens began circulating in great quantity in British North America due to a severe currency shortage caused by increased commercial activity, and to an initial distrust of the series of paper notes known as ""army bills'' issued by Brock.

It was reported to have been taken from an American Officer and delivered to General Murray of the 100th regiment, during the capture of Fort Niagara on December 19, 1813. Following the retreat of American forces from Niagara and the subsequent burning of the town, the British wasted no time reoccupying the ruins of Fort George and planning an assault on Fort Niagara. More than five hundred soldiers crossed the Niagara River to Five Mile Meadows on the night of December 19, 1813 and silently turned north toward Youngstown. American pickets stationed in the village were taken by surprise, and the attackers obtained the garrison password. A short march carried them to Fort Niagara where they burst through a partially open gate and caught the garrison unprepared. With Fort Niagara secured, the British and their Indian allies marched back upriver, destroying farms and villages on the New York side as far as Manchester (present day Niagara Falls). A second British raid at the end of December burned Buffalo and completed the devastation of the Niagara Frontier. Only the buildings of Fort Niagara were left intact to shelter a British garrison. An officer indicated surrender by offering his sword to his conqueror. The sword, then, became the symbol of the victory and was surpassed only by an enemy's flag or ""colours"" and by his artillery pieces as trophies of war.

971.271,Rifle,"A British Enfield Martini-Henry Mk. III 1879 rifle with a walnut stock and steel barrel with an Enfield stamp. The firing mechanism is one with breech loading and a cartridge ejector. Was likely used during the First World War and possibly the Second World War as well (the shoulder strap attached to the rifle is WWII era), but the exact dates of use are unknown.This rifle was featured in ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" and this description was prepared by Neil Middleton.""This steel barreled, Italian walnut stocked Martin Henry (Enfield) rifle was used by those Niagara militiamen who participated, under the command of Colonel Sir Frederick Middleton, in the suppression of the Northwest Rebellion of 1885.Ê The rifle had been adopted by the British army and Canadian militia in 1871 and continued in service into the 20th century.Ê It was the first purpose-designed breech loading rifle in the British Army (slightly incorrect - the Ferguson Rifle was produced and used on a very small scale during the American Revolutionary War).Ê It was a combination of the falling block mechanism devised by Frederich Martini (1832-97), a Swiss gunsmith and the seven-groove rifling devised by Edinburgh gunsmith Alexander Henry (1817-95). The Martini-Henry was popular with the soldiers because it only weighed 9 lb (4 kg) unloaded, was very robust, easy to strip and clean, and had few and easily replaceable parts.As for Middleton, he was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1825 and saw service in many parts of the British Empire, including Quebec where he had married EugŽnie Doucet of Montreal.Ê In 1884, he had accepted the normally placid position of General Officer commanding Canada's militia.Ê As a consequence of his victory over the ill-equipped MŽtis rebels at the Battle of Batoche (in what is now Saskatchewan) on 12 May 1885, and the capture of their leader Louis Riel three days later, Middleton was granted a gift of $20,000 from the Parliament of Canada and given a knighthood by Queen Victoria.Ê He resigned command of the Canadian Militia in 1890 and returned to Great Britain where he was rewarded with the sinecure of Keeper of the Crown Jewels. He died in 1898.""In January 2010 Steven Baxter added these notes on the rifle:Martini-Henry Mk IÐIVType: Service riflePlace of origin: United KingdomService historyIn service: 1871Ð1918Used by: United KingdomÊ & ColoniesWars: British colonial wars, Second Anglo-Afghan War, Anglo-Zulu War, Boer War, Mahdist War, World War IProduction historyDesigner: RSAF EnfieldDesigned: 1870Manufacturer: VariousProduced: 1871Ðc.1891Number built: approx. 500,000Ð1,000,000Variants: Martini-Henry CarbineSpecifications:Weight 8 pounds 7 ounces (3.827 kg) (unloaded), 9 pounds, 4.75 ounces (with sword bayonet)Length 49 inches (124.5 cm)Cartridge: .577/450 Martini-HenryCalibre: .577/450 Martini-HenryAction: Martini Falling Block /Peabody actionRate of fire: 10 rounds/minuteMuzzle velocity: 900 ft/s (270 m/s)Effective range: 600 yd (550 m)Maximum range: 1,500 yd (1,400 m)Feed system: Single shotSights: Sliding ramp rear sights, Fixed-post front sightsThe Martini-Henry saw service in World War I in a variety of rolesÑprimarily as a Reserve Arm, but it was also issued (in the early stages of the war) to aircrew for attempting to shoot down observation ballons and other aircraft.

972.258,Clog,"This is an example of a patten or slipshod from the late 18th century. Pattens are a protective overshoe that were worn outdoors to keep the wearer elevated above the mud/dirt before urban paving was introduced. Pattens were popular right from the Middle Ages to the late-19th century. This patten shows a wooden sole with leather and velvet strap over the ankle; an iron ring attached to the bottom gives the patten the height it needed.

This patten was featured in the book, ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" which has this to say, ""How many times have you heard the phrase ""She is a slipshod housekeeper"" or ""that work is slipshod""? I was intrigued to discover the derivation offered in Lorraine O'Byrne's (Former Curator of Black Creek Pioneer Village) booklet ""What is it?"" The picture showed a farm woman ""slippershod"", elevated some five centimetres on top of pattens: two oval iron rings separated by two struts under a thin wooden sole with leather straps tied over the instep. Her skirt and petticoats were lifted and the slippers saved from dirt or snow when she gardened or collected eggs from coop or root cellar. Upper class women with servants went out for walks outdoors. Neither beaded moccasins nor silk slippers stand up to the ground without pattens.
Pattens are centuries old. Elizabeth Semmelhack (Curator Bata Shoe Museum) explained that the dating depends on the sole's toe shape: almond shaped in the 1760's to pointier towards 1800 and squarish from 1800-1850's. (This is) most likely from the 1770's or 1780's.
Wooden shoes and clogs were universal. Colonial ""wedding shoes"" - leather sole, instep, and wooden 5-7cm heel covered with brocade- needed clogs to lift all off the dirt so the shoes could last for church and parties.
As the horses needed ""shoes"" to prevent slipping, so the shoe makers needed blacksmiths to create pattens. They were practical and saved our pioneer women from being merely slippershod (slipshod) to having a better understanding for all the hard work needed.""",1770,1780,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/30BF7D29-CE3D-4BC7-856C-214285949312,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/051/thumbs/972258.jpg
972.259,Dress,"After decades of wide hips and tightly laced torsos, a shift in fashion occurred at the end of the 1700s. Women's clothing was influenced by the early Greek and Roman style and was made from light-weight fabrics. The waistline rose significantly and sat under the bust to create a straight silhouette. Dresses either had short puffed sleeves or were long and narrow. This silhouette remained through the 1810's, but dresses were now made from heavier textiles.  This dress, dated to the late-1700s to ca. 1809, adheres to the fashion of this period as it is made of light weight cotton muslin, features puffed sleeves, and the waistline sits right under the bust, which is a drop front bust. The skirt has a slight train. The documentation on this dress originally stated that it was worn by Anne Smith, the daughter of the First Surveyor General of Upper Canada, D.W. Smith. However, Anne would have been too young to wear a dress of this people. Research indicates that it was likely worn by Jane Isabella (nee Clark) Smith, the wife of Samuel Smith, who was the Administrator of the Province. They married in Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) in 1799.",1805,1805,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/390A3C1F-31CB-4907-A716-274403373582,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/thumbs/972259.jpg
972.263,Quilt,"The Women's Institute of Niagara contributed to the war effort through many fundraisers including this autograph quilt, completed in 1917. Cotton squares measuring approximately 8"" x 8"" were sold for $16 and a maximum of 16 people signed their names on each one. The Women's Institute members then sewed over the autographs in red thread and outlined memorable buildings of the town. The centre square has a large red cross surrounded by maple leaves (proceeds went to the Canadian Red Cross war effort during the First World War). Buildings depicted include Fort Mississauga and each of the Town's churches accompanied by the pastor's signature: St. Andrew's, St. Mark's, St. Vincent de Paul and Grace United. Among notable squares is Janet Carnochan's where her titles of Vice-President of the Ontario Historical Society and President of Niagara's society are recorded and that of Nenagh Hall on Queen Street which today is known as the Charles Inn. Several military units paid for squares. Following World War I, the autograph quilt was put on display in the Historical Museum.

972.33,Quilt,"The crazy quilt-called for its randomly shaped patches-may be one of the oldest known pieced pattern style quilts. Women collected any bits and pieces of fabric around the house, often leftovers from other home needlework or worn clothing was cut to salvage fabric that could be used to construct this style of quilt. When the sewing of the patches was completed the quilt was often embellished, sometimes these embellishments began after the maker's death, and included elaborate embroidery, beads, lace, dried flowers and even painted designs. The style of quilt hit its craze in the late Victorian era when quilting started to morph from a necessary domestic task to a leisure activity. A great example of the Crazy Quilt style in the collection is a Crazy Quilt made from pieces of embroidery completed by Laura Secord. The quilt was compiled by Augusta Smith, Laura's granddaughter. Note that the quilt was never completed. The butterfly embroidered on the quilt is very reminiscent of a drawing (988.294) that was done by Laura Secord and copied by Miss. Goring.It is not clear if all the embroidery on the quilt was made by Laura or if her granddaughter had a hand in adding her own personal touches to the quilt. According to Janet Carnochan and her research (NHS 25), Laura was always very kind and thoughtful to children and to many of the old soldiers, who had served with her husband. She was very fond of gardening, and the flowers embroidered on this quilt may reflect this passion.

972.65,Waistcoat,"Ready-made clothing was scarce in Niagara in the late 1700s. While there was demand from the newly arrived loyalist settlers, there were few skilled tailors and clothes were expensive. An individual's wardrobe was limited and was manufactured with the intention that it would last for many years. Moreover, cloth was expensive and difficult to obtain in Upper Canada, nearly every yard had to be imported. This waistcoat was not designed for utility, setting it apart from the clothing worn by most of the early settlers in Niagara in the late 1700s. Adorned with false pockets, floral trim and steel beads, this silk waistcoat is clearly identifiable as the property of a wealthy individual. Robert Hamilton, the owner of this garment, was one of the most influential settlers in early Upper Canada. He began his business in 1780 in Queenston and made a fortune provisioning the British military and First Nations refugees from the United States. Supplying these groups required immense resources and Hamilton was quick to capitalize on the demand. He went on to build an extensive network of merchandising and land speculation which had a tremendous impact on the settlement pattern of Niagara, most of which he personally oversaw through his active involvement in local politics. Hamilton was criticized for using his position as Justice of the Peace, Judge of the Court of Common Peace and Member of the Land Board to advance his own business interests, all of which had a lasting impact on the community at Niagara. A merchant and politician, Hamilton was the main wholesaler of grain, held most of the settler's mortgages, supplied a majority of the goods and was the primary purchaser of the lands of the early settlers. This garment would have been worn as he served in his various court functions and is a fitting reminder of Robert Hamilton's patronage and power. Hamilton's legacy remains in Niagara in the settlement pattern, the roads, and personal artifacts such as this elegant waistcoat.",1780,1780,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/19E3B203-8626-4D0C-9352-492938786944,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/057/thumbs/97265.jpg

She is made of wood and papier-m‰chŽ. The materials are of European influence. Before the introduction of glass beads this native doll would have been decorated with bone shell and stone beads.

972.903,Uniform:Coat,"This coat was worn by Fort Major Donald Campbell who was buried at Fort George in December 1812. The red wool coat with black flannel wool is a very early type, common shortly after 1800.  It features blue facings, buttons in pairs, a rounded cut at the waist and white piping.  The high stand-up collar is missing and adjustable lapels.  There is a silver epaulet at the left shoulder, but it isn't known whether this is original to the coat.  There is also a false pocket on the back. Being the Fort-Major of Fort George (an administrative position) meant you worked directly for the British army and did not report to any particular regiment.  Your rank might not even be major.  It was usually more junior.    As Fort-Major, Campbell could have worn a coat of one of his previous regiments.  None of them, however, had blue facings and paired buttons.  There is also the possibility that Campbell bought this coat from another officer.  It does resemble the warrant for the 10th Royal Veterans Battalion, who were in Canada at that time.  It is more likely that this coat was made for Campbell in a generic British officer's style.  There appears to be no specific uniform requirement for his position.   Campbell had a long and wide-ranging career in the military.  In his senior years, the position as Fort-Major would have been very welcome.  His family lived with him in Niagara.  Campbell died of unknown causes in December 1812, at age 57 and was buried in the central west bastion of Fort George.  Campbell's son tried to buy his father's burial plot many years later.  It isn't known if the burial site was disturbed during reconstruction of Fort George during the 1930's.    The Campbell family suffered through the trials of war in Niagara.  They lost a loved one, were caught in the middle of the Battle of Fort George (May 27, 1813), endured American occupation and were burnt out, along with the rest of the town on December 10, 1813.",1810,1810,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/3F3413BA-7B75-4C7C-B5DE-642419712889,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972903-2.jpg
972.91,Uniform:Coat,"This is a wool and velvet coat that is believed to be designed for a Glengarry Militia Officer, but the date of origin is unknown. It is a single breasted green coat with a velvet trimmed stand up collar and cuffs. There are also three rows of buttons down the front. Decorative lace on the face and cuffs has been removed and the wings are missing from the shoulder. Theory states that this jacket belonged to Ensign Donald McDougald who served in the militia unit on the Niagara frontier during the War of 1812 (987.5.464). He was also in the 2nd Regiment of the Glengarry Militia as a Lieutenant as of September 1st 1839. This might mean that the tunic was his during the later stages of his service to the Militia. The coat could possibly be from 1812, however the buttons put it at a later date. The curved ""heart shaped"" pattern of the buttons on each side of the breast is different from the 1812-1815 straight pattern.   Little is known of Glengarry Militia Coatees and Glengarry Light Infantry (GLIF) Uniforms.  At first, this coat was documented as a GLIF uniform, but current research dispells that, however, continued research is required on this uncommon artefact.   It is possible that components of the uniform are from the War of 1812 as well, as many Militia coats were used well after the War of 1812 by soldiers as the continued in their Militia service, being changed and modified to reflect the changes to new uniforms.",1795,1830,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/F5299958-D8D9-4F26-8832-381235672801,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972910-7.jpg
972.912,Uniform:Coat,"This battalion officer's coat is believed to have been worn by Captain John McMicking of the Lincoln Militia.

John McMicking, who resided in Stamford (now part of Niagara Falls), fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights during the War of 1812. Some of the uniform features appear to be later than 1812, including the shield shaped lapels, the domed buttons, and the gold lace on the edge of the cuffs, which could mean that McMicking's uniform was modified after the war.

This wool coat is double breasted with adjustable or reversible lapels. There is also fine black and gold lace on the stand up collar and the small of the back and two epaulettes on the shoulder.  This coat most likely predates the War of 1812, but soldiers would have several coats available to them depending on the situation. Shaw was born in Scotland and was the 2nd son of Angus (14th Chief of the Clan Shaw) and Anne Shaw. He was in the Queen's Rangers during the American Revolution, the  same unit that Lt. Gov.

He married a Nancy Ann Gorsline of Newtown, Long Island in 1783 and who died in 1806 after giving him 7 sons. He came to Newark with John Graves Simcoe in 1792 and moved his family to Newark (Niagara) in 1793 where served as a member of the executive council from 1794 to 1807.

The strips of fabric bound on two sides of each block feature embroidery patterns commonly found on crazy quilts and the border of the quilt, made of varying colours of fabric tringles, is also an edging technique found in Crazy Quilts. While its maker is not known, this quilt represents a way that women create their own designs. At first, women took their patterns from quilts that had been shared by someone they knew, but by the end of the 19th century, ladies' magazines and newspapers began publishing and advertising patterns, making them more readily available. Every time a quilter made a slight variation to a pattern, it was given a new name.

988.199,Painting:Watercolour,"A watercolour painting of William Dickson by Hoppner Meyer
Born in Dumfries, Scotland in 1769, William Dickson emigrated to Canada at the age of 15. He originally worked for his cousin, Robert Hamilton, the enormously successful Queenston merchant and shipowner whose enterprises were based on the portage route around Niagara Falls. Dickson soon went into business for himself in Niagara, selling supplies to both the military garrison and to the local settlers. By 1790, Dickson had become a successful businessman and is credited with building the first brick house in the Niagara peninsula.
In 1794, Dickson married Charlotte Adlam; they eventually had three sons. He was a member of the Niagara Library and of the Niagara Agricultural Society, a trustee of the district grammar school, and a justice of the peace. In 1803, Dickson was given a special license by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada to practise law which he did for a number of years, at times acting as judge of the District Court.
During the War of 1812, Dickson was arrested by invading American forces and was being held as a prisoner in Albany, when the town of Niagara was burned in December 1813. Lost in the fire was not only a house recently built on a large tract of land he had purchased south of the Commons but also a magnificent library of 1,000 volumes. As the town began its process of rebuilding following the war, it benefited from the gift of a part of Dickson's land tract upon which the second Courthouse was built.
Dickson then turned his attention to his large land holdings along the Grand River.
There, he aided a group of Pennsylvania Mennonites in a difficult transaction. He made arrangements with agents in Scotland to encourage immigration to his land. Dickson was known for his paternal treatment of the settlers, advancing large sums of money, not requiring substantial down payments, and ensuring that they had stock, implements, and provisions. Once his settlements were prosperous, Dickson returned to Niagara where he died in 1846.",1840,1840,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/31670C22-10B0-418D-9214-386846112605,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/thumbs/988199.jpg

988.243,Print,"A print called ""The Trial of Red Jacket"" that was originally painted in 1869 by John Mix Stanley and is held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. There is an inscription on the left corner that reads: ""Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1871 by John M. Stanley in the Clerk's office of the Eastern District of Michigan"" and on the left, ""J.M. Stanley, 1869"". Red Jacket (1758-1830) was a famous leader of the Seneca tribe of the Iroquois Nation. In this ambitious painting, John Mix Stanley showed the chief defending himself against a charge of witchcraft. Under his white robe is the red jacket given to him by a British officer for his help as a messenger during the American Revolution. Stanley trained as a portrait painter, and all of the figures in this work are portraits of identifiable individuals. ""The Trial of Red Jacket"" was almost destroyed in the Smithsonian Institution's fire of 1865. We know from documents in the LLB collection that Red Jacket was on the US pay roll of the Corps of Indian Volunteers during the occupation of Niagara by American forces and received his pay at Fort George (12 August 1813 - 11 September 1813).",1869,1869,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/9D5262B9-2162-4136-B4C7-448545986140,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/018/thumbs/988243-2.jpg

988.254,Print,"This engraving, circa 1880s, shows American troops (shown in blue uniforms) crossing the Niagara River and landing at Queenston. British and Canadian troops (shown in red uniforms) under General Isaac Brock came out of Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) and drove the Americans back to the heights. Seeing this, New York militiamen still on the American shore refused to cross into Canada to reinforce the troops there. General Brock was killed during an advance towards the doomed Americans on the heights. This copy was done by T. Sutherland  and the original sketch was made by James Dennis (1796-1855), the senior British officer at Queenston when the Americans first landed. His grenadier company of the 49th (the Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot fought throughout the battle.

988.262,Print,"Coloured print of an original watercolour from 1871 (by J.D. Kelly) and includes a hand-written note identifying the figures in the painting. It depicts the opening of the first Parliament in Upper Canada by the British Parliament. Smart red-coated soldiers stand at attention as Lt. Governor John Graves Simcoe arrives riding a sleek black horse. The colours are autumnal and among the bright yellow trees are smartly dressed on-lookers, both officials and local citizens. On the reverse of the print is the text:

""In 1791 a Bill known as The Constitutional Act was passed in the British Parliament, dividing distance of the western part of the colony from the seat of government at Quebec, and also that the French in Lower Canada might retain their own system of government, while for the English in Upper Canada might be created a system in harmony with their traditions.
Colonel John Graves Simcoe, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, and a man of wide experience, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. He arrived, at Quebec, in late autumn and spent the winter there.

The induction of Governor Simcoe was celebrated at Kingston on the 18th of July 1792, amidst the most primitive surroundings, yet with military pomp and ceremony.

His Executive Council was Formed of:
Messrs.:
William Osgood, Chief Justice,
James Baby,
Alexander Grant,
Peter Russell, Receiver General,

In addition to these were
Robert Hamilton,
Richard Cartwright,
John Munro,
Members of the Legislative Council ,

Among the Members of the Legislative Assembly, an Elective Body, were:
Messrs.:
John White - Attorney General,
John Macdonell,
E. W. Smith,
David Burns, Clerk ol the Crown
Richard Pollard, Sheriff
Alex Macdonell, Sheriff
William Jarvis, Secretary of the Province.

On the 21st of July, Governor Simcoe set out on a westward journey, establishing the Capital of the new Province at Newark, a small village at the mouth of the Niagara River, now known as Niagara-on-the-Lake.
On the west bank of the picturesque Niagara, within sound, on a calm day, of the mighty cataract, was built the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, known as Navy Hall, and, within its log walls, the first Parliament of Upper Canada assembled on the 17th of September 1792.
The artist has made a most artistic and interesting picture of Simcoe opening his little Parliament with all the dignity and ceremony at his command. No matter if the place of meeting was only a plain structure of wood, and the members of the House few in number, a new State had come into being; cannon roared in salute; the Lieutenant-Governor, mounted and in full military uniform, was received and escorted by a Guard of Honour from the Northumberland Fusiliers, elaborate in their striking military equipment. He entered the Chamber with stately bearing. The members of the House were summoned to his presence and he made his Speech from the Throne on the exact model of Westminster.
The picture has been reconstructed from the best available records. A number of authentic portraits of historical personages, who took part, are shown in the picture.""",1932,1932,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/1AB0A355-591E-4B50-81BD-395762264857,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/026/thumbs/988262.jpg

The Wilderness House is located between King Street and Regent Street, Mary Street and John G. Williams was a local artist who completed many pencil and charcoal sketches of scenes in St. Catharines and Niagara-on-the-lake. Born in Brighton England, as a young man he worked as a photgrapher and a librarian. In 1911 he came to Canada, working as a photographer during the Welland Canal construction. In 1917 when work on the canal was halted due to the Great War, he began a job as a tax collector for the City of St. Catharines, a position he held until retiring in 1949. The sketches in the collection of the Niagara Historical Museum we completed in the 1950's. John G. Williams died in 1960.

This remarkable propertyÑfour heavily forested acres in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake---has passed intact through many hands since its origin as a crown grant to a veteran of ButlerÕs Rangers in 1796.

The first private purchaser was Robert Pilkington, a military engineer in the intimate circle of John Graves Simcoe, who assigned Pilkington numerous commissions to erect fortifications and public buildings in Upper Canada. After only a year of ownership, Pilkington conveyed the property in 1799 to Ann Claus, in a most unusual transaction.

Ann Claus was the daughter of the colonial magnate Sir William Johnson, the widow of JohnsonÕs chief assistant in the Indian Department, and the mother of William Claus who in 1796 succeeded John Butler as deputy Indian commissioner for the Six Nations reserve. According to the records, the purchase money was obtained by the sale of reserve land, the tribes then conveying the town property to Ann Claus in gratitude for her (deceased) husbandÕs ""many kindnesses"", a piece of business which could have been transacted only with the permission and guidance of her son William, the financial trustee of the Six Nations.

William built the first house, but it was destroyed by the American army in 1813, when its root cellar provided winter refuge for the family of an officer at Fort George. The house was rebuilt, and William lived there until his death in 1826. He often received his Indian wards there, who camped by the banks of One-Mile-Creek, which flows through the property. The present house consists of considerable extensions upon the original 1816-17 construction, and is shielded from view by a forest which includes some extraordinarily tall and broad trees, some of them centuries old. Claus was a pioneering arborist, who planted the very tall stand of sycamores which line the property on its King Street boundary. He also introduced soft-fruit cultivation to Niagara, with an orchard of nectarines and peaches; today, only a single ancient pear tree survives from that orchard. Claus left diaries recording not only the progress of the building, but also the planting of flowers, trees, and vines in the extensive grounds

In the 1850Õs the property was sold to yet another family prominent in the pioneer annals of Niagara, the Dicksons. Walter H. Dickson was the only son of NiagaraÕs richest man, William Dickson, whose magnificent home was burned in 1813 when Walter was seven, and William was away in a prisoner of war camp. The family fortune began with trade, but grew mightily through land speculation throughout the province, and Walter lived as a lawyer and Conservative politician until his appointment to the first Canadian Senate, in 1867. After his death in 1885, the property passed out of his family.

The introduction of the jacquard loom in the early 1800s revolutionized weaving by simplifying the production of complex patterns by using punched or cut cards that guided the weaving process. The first use of a jacquard loom in Canada was in 1834, by Wilhelm Armbrust at his shop near Jordan, Ontario. He, like other early weavers, prepared his own patterns and cut the cards for his loom. Due to the complexity of jacquard woven coverlets, the profession became male dominated. However, professional women coverlet weavers are not totally unknown, but the more common role of women was in the preparation of the wool, spinning and dyeing it, before it was given to a weaver to be transformed into a coverlet.",1860,1860,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/C373751F-220A-4721-B5BA-521444844409,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/077/thumbs/993052-5.jpg

She taught in Niagara, Brantford, Kingston and Peterborough prior to taking up the post of Principal, at the age of 32, for the Niagara Public School in 1872. She was the first female Principal in Niagara. This appointment sparked local opposition, but she soon proved her ability to take up the task.  After 6 years, she became the Assistant Principal at the Niagara Grammar (High) School, holding the position for 23 years (with only 2 weeks absence). Society President for 30 years. A professional historian by early twentieth century standards, Janet was an avid researcher and writer, both editing and contributing to the Society's historical pamphlets. Her books include the histories of St. Mark's and St. Andrew's Churches (1892, 1894) and the History of Niagara (1914), which is still regarded as the best resource for local history. Under her guidance, the organization amassed a collection of significant artefacts related to the history of Niagara-on-the-Lake and the Niagara Region. She even became the curator of the collection, a position she held for 25 years. Owen Staples (1866-1949) was a Canadian painter, etcher, pastelist, political cartoonist, author, musician and naturalist.

994.484,Sampler,"Young girls were expected to grow up, get married, have children and care for their family home.

Girls were often taught only arithmetic or reading-if their parents could afford to pay for their schooling-along with other skills that were considered to be ""female accomplishments"". This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. This charming traditional sampler is the work of Susan Chubbuck. The Chubbucks were well-known early merchants in Niagara.  Job Chubbuck built the Chubbuck block, a large building on Front Street in Queenston that was used at various times as a boarding house, restaurant, bank and hotel.

The number 2 seen on this bag is an indicator of size, and different numbers corresponded to different size gas masks. Bags such as these were worn on the front of the body, with the opening flap pressed against the body to protect the mask from dirt while a soldier crawled. This may explain the damage on both sides of this bag, caused by friction.

1998.003.135,Cane,"Among the more unusual items in the museum, and perhaps the most stunning, is a collection of 24 glass walking sticks. Although completely impractical, thousands of glass canes were crafted in the glasshouses of England, Europe and the United States for over four centuries.For the sheer delight of making lovely and interesting ""objets,"" glassmakers would, on their own time, take the left-over sand, soda ash and lime of their trade and create pieces for their own use and pleasure or to improve their skills. They worked with molten glass to make glass chains, sock darners, bells, rolling pins, horns and walking sticks. These ""Friggers"" in England or ""glasshouse whimsies"" elsewhere were often given as gifts or used to decorate the houses of these master craftsmen.  There are two types of glass canes - the first was made out of a solid piece of twisted glass with spirals of coloured glass forming its core and decorated with a crook or handle. The second was made from blown glass and is hollow with a rounded knob handle. Some of these canes were as tall as five meters.One of the first uses of these sticks was ceremonial - they were carried by glassmakers in their guild parades. Later, copying Marie Antionette's playing the rustic shepherdess at the Petit Trianon, fashionable English ladies carried glass shepherd's crooks decorated with flowers and ribbons. In the nineteenth century, glass canes were part of the costume of some English dandies.The museum's collection of glass whimsies was the gift of the Toronto interior designer, David Whitmore, who owned a house on the corner of Victoria and Johnson until his death in 1998.",0,0,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/8FF6867A-1653-4BA0-B6BB-121940832400,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/thumbs/1998003135.jpg

1998.142.4,Bottle:Medicine,"Glass dispensing bottle from Field's Drug Store.

The Apothecary had a long-standing history in Niagara-on-the-Lake as it was in continuous operation for almost 150 years. Field took over the practice from Arthur James Coyne in 1922. To the people of Niagara-on-the-Lake, his business was known as ""Field Drugs"" and his window displays featured toiletries, cosmetic and hair products sold at the location. When Erland's health declined in 1964 he closed the pharmacy, and in 1965, he had made sure that the Niagara Foundation and the Ontario College of Pharmacists had the first right to purchase the property; which was owned by the Niagara Foundation until the Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired the property, restored it and opened it as a museum in 1971. Today the Apothecary still operates as a Museum that is run by the Ontario College of Pharmacists.
Erland Field was born and raised in Virgil, Niagara-on-the-Lake and attended the High School located on Castlereagh Street. During the First World War he enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps on June 21, 1915 at Niagara Camp. He was overseas 5 months later where he became part of the Fifth Canadian Field Ambulance, and then in 1917 he was transferred to the First Canadian Clearing Station. He saw service in France, Belgium, and Germany. He retuned home after almost 3 years of service and continued living in Virgil and was an active member in the community.

The Centennial offered the Chiefs of the Six Nations an opportunity to make public their ongoing grievances with the Canadian government. Using their undeniable contribution to the War of 1812, Six Nations Chiefs were actively involved with the ceremonies, making speeches and public appearances to emphasize their sacrifice and continued struggle to have their treaty rights respected.Chief William D. Loft was appointed to create the wreath and it was placed at the base of Brock's Monument at Queenston Heights on October 13, 1912.

During the ceremony, Chief De-ka-nen-ra-neh (A. G. Smith) gave a speech lamenting the lack of justice to the Six Nations in the historical record and expressed a desire to obtain representation in the Canadian House of Commons.

2004.002.021(A&B),Box,"A dispensing box from Field's Drug Store. A box like this one would have been picked up by customers who went to the Apothecary (5 Queen Street) when it was owed by Erland Field. The Apothecary had a long-standing history in Niagara-on-the-Lake as it was in continuous operation for almost 150 years. Field took over the practice from Arthur James Coyne in 1922. To the people of Niagara-on-the-Lake, his business was known as ""Field Drugs"" and his window displays featured toiletries, cosmetic and hair products sold at the location. When Erland's health declined in 1964 he closed the pharmacy, and in 1965, he had made sure that the Niagara Foundation and the Ontario College of Pharmacists had the first right to purchase the property; which was owned by the Niagara Foundation until the Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired the property, restored it and opened it as a museum in 1971. Today the Apothecary still operates as a Museum that is run by the Ontario College of Pharmacists.
Erland Field was born and raised in Virgil, Niagara-on-the-Lake and attended the High School located on Castlereagh Street. During the First World War he enlisted in the Canadian Army Medical Corps on June 21, 1915 at Niagara Camp.

Al Derbyshire wrote, ""My first recollection of Lancelot Cressy Servos is when he would visit his mother who lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake just across the street from my residence.  Although he did not live in Niagara he did visit quite often.  On several occasions I would see him going to the golf course with a couple of clubs and some golf balls.  I would follow him and watch him hit good shots to the green hoping some day I would be able to hit golf balls as well as he did.  I was only in my early teens at the time.Although there is no evidence of him ever having been a member of the Royal Niagara Golf Club, as it was known at that time, he was associated with the Club and in the early 1900's donated the Servos Trophy for competition by the men.  This trophy is still being played for.Although he was a Canadian, most of his work concerning golf took place in the United States, mostly in Florida.  He designed several of the oldest courses and, as stated in his book, which is reputed to be the first book on golf written in Canada, he would visit there, join up with other golf professionals and play a round.  He says the merchants at that time would close their shops and go out to watch these professional golfers play.Mr. Servos starts his book with the following.  Quote 'Time marches on.  Man Conspires, respires, aspires, and expires.  During which sojourn, if he is fortunate, he plays a little golf and perspires.  He may get so that he plays it very well.  Or he may not be able to play it as well as he would like.  It is for those who would like to improve their golf that this book is published.  For what gaineth a man if he acquire the whole world and yet in unable to play golf.'""",1900,1900,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/4DCF078B-A956-4216-BAB2-156438509840,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/thumbs/2004007007(ae).jpg

The first-class hotel, run initially by a former steamboat Captain, became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake.  It had recreational activities, a beach, small cottages, breezy verandahs with rocking chairs and a peaceful waterfront park within which to stroll. The advancement of roads and cars and the beginning of the Depression era led to the demise of the Hotel in 1927. After several furnishings were auctioned off the building was demolished in 1930.

The pottery was produced as a hobby and the output was mainly sold to friends. There were no duplicates of any of the pieces. All were one of a kind. The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg. The pottery was once located at 17 Prideaux Street in Niagara-on-the-Lake, a small cottage next door to Dr Bruce Rigg office and at a home on King Street.The sites featured include:St. Andrew's Presbyterian ChurchSt. Mark's Anglican ChurchSt. Vincent de Paul Churchthe Waterfrontthe Public Library (originally in the Courthouse)Fort Niagara",1950,1955,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/0CCE7ABA-AFE8-4F3B-AB81-757290008023,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/046/thumbs/2007007021.jpg

These expectations meant that girls often received a very different education then boys. Girls were often taught only arithmetic or reading-if their parents could afford to pay for their schooling-along with other skills that were considered to be ""female accomplishments"". This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. To prepare a young girl for the responsibility of sewing for her future family, girls completed at least two samplers. The first, called a marking sampler, was completed when a girl was around 5 or 6 (sometimes older) and served two purposes: to teach basic embroidery and numbers and the alphabet. This sample which was started by Ann Woodruff at around 1800 is a great example of a marking sampler.

2008.022.007,Painting,"A water-colour painting of St. Andrew's Church, Niagara-on-the-Lake by Betty Lane. The painting is underneath glass and wood framed.

The congregation of St. Andrew's Church was established by 1794, possibly earlier. The Gleaner of 1831 states that the first church was on the site of the present church. The original church was destroyed as the American forces retreated from the town and set it ablaze in 1813. Construction of the present Church of St. Andrew's began on May 31st, 1831. James Cooper was the architect of the building; it mirrors the New England influence on many of the homes that were built in town after the War of 1812.
Members of St. Andrew's Church are treated to one of the most stunning pulpits in the area. The pulpit and sounding board were fashioned by John Davidson, a local joiner and were a gift from member and benefactor, John Young. When the new church was complete, pews went to the highest bidder. The least expensive pew went for £8 and the most expensive went to Jared Stocking for £40.

As a child Betty was encouraged by her parents to pursue her artistic skills. She studied in Paris at the age of 21 and was recognized early on for her talent. She was funded by millionaire art patron Duncan Phillips and it was in his gallery in Washington DC where famed artist Henri Matisse took notice of her work. In particular, he remarked on one titled ""The Walls"".
Betty moved to Niagara-on-the-Lake in the 1940s with her husband, Gerald Noxon, and son, Nicolas. The family lived in the William Kirby home at 130 Front Street. Her son recalled exploring the countryside together and, at one time, seeing German prisoners of war who were used as labourers. She was inspired by the raw beauty of Niagara-on-the-Lake and the countryside, creating and selling many scenes of the Forts, the lake and the community. Betty eventually moved to Cape Cod where she spent the rest of her life as a painter and musician.",1940,1950,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/C92C1D59-FB68-41A3-BB63-493307969774,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/005/thumbs/2008022007.jpg

2009.004.019(A-C),Handkerchief,"Designed by Fortunino Matania, this silk handkerchief was produced as part of the fundraising efforts for ""Italian Day"", which took place on October 7, 1915 in London, England. The event was organized by several Italian organizations in London eager to demonstrate their commitment to the Allied cause during the First World War. The illustration featured on this handkerchief is one of many pieces created during the war by Italian artist Fortunino Matania. Matanaia was born in 1881 to the respected Italian artist Eduardo Matania. Eduardo was employed as an artist in the publishing industry and his son seems to have learned from his father how to draw. Fortunino must have quickly picked up the family business quickly because the Italian publication ""L'Illustrazione"" began to receive submissions signed 'Fortunino Matania' when the boy was just 14 years old. Thinking at first that this was a prank being pulled by Eduardo's, the editors were astonished when the young boy arrived at their Milan office and demonstrated his incredible skills and they hired him on the spot.He continued to illustrate for various publishers and served for a time in the Army, becoming a highly capable war artist during World War one. His concern for artistic accuracy was meticulous to the point of eccentricity. He visited the front on several occasions, was provided with military equipment by the War Office, and built a replica trench in the garden of his home near London. This design, known as ""Pro Italia"", is one of 117 of Matania's pictures that were reproduced in London's ""The Sphere"" throughout the war. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1918 and in other major exhibitions in London and Italy. This handkerchief was purchased in support of the Italian Day ceremony by a Niagara-on-the-Lake family member who was serving in Europe and sent it home as a souvenir. The example is unique because it includes the original box it was packaged in.

The hotel offered religious and educational courses for guests of varying ages, botany and drawing classes, music concerts, swimming, tennis, lawn bowling, fishing, boating and croquet.The grounds included the 3-storey hotel building, a 4,000-seat amphitheatre in the middle of the grounds, and 500 lots for sale or lease for vacationers to build summer cottages.With a rail spur connection from John Street by the Michigan Central Railway, a wharf that could accommodate steamships, and popular entertainment that was even well-received by locals, the hotel was set for success. Sadly, its semi-religious atmosphere did not have the appeal that was expected. The hotel was purchased by the Niagara Syndicate around 1894, which ran the resort until it burned in 1909.Burning of Chautauqua, 1909On August 27, 1909, fishermen noticed a column of smoke rising from the Hotel basement at 3:20pm. Within 10 minutes the frame building was completely destroyed by fire. Guests barely had time to escape. Reports mentioned half-dressed men and women escaping the building, some jumping from the balconies. It was believed that the fire started in the servantsâ€™ quarters in the basement from the explosion of a lamp one of the girls had been using to curl her hair.

To the people of Niagara-on-the-Lake, his business was known as ""Field Drugs"" and his window displays featured toiletries, cosmetic and hair products sold at the location.

Over 22,000 American and Canadian men of Polish heritage trained in Ascher's hometown of Niagara-on-the-Lake to fight overseas with the French army in 1917-1918. An outspoken advocate of the restoration of Poland, Elizabeth was committed to increase awareness and support of the movement to restore an independent Polish government. In 1918, a horrific outbreak of Spanish influenza spread among soldiers in Niagara and Elizabeth risked her life to take care of sick soldiers, earning the moniker ""The Angel of Mercy"" among the troops. The flu claimed the lives of 24 Polish soldiers in training and Ascher immediately began lobbying for the creation of a Polish Military Cemetery at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Elizabeth Ascher's humanitarian efforts continued when she organized a fundraising campaign to help the civilian population in Poland which also sent care packages to Polish soldiers in Europe.
In 1922, Elizabeth was officially recognized for her efforts when she was granted the medal of the Polonia Restituta in 1922. Accolades continued to accumulate for Asher; she was granted the Medal of Haller, the Medal of Haller's Swords, the Polish Cross of Merit and the Polish Medal for Long Service in 1938.

930.6.3,Teacup,"A Queen's Royal Hotel teacup with green borders and the hotel crest of a lion and unicorn.Known as one of the most beautiful and lavish hotels, it first opened in 1869 as the Royal Niagara.

It became the destination of choice for those who wanted to escape the confines of the city and enjoy a peaceful time by the lake. This was one of the finest hotels in North America. The hotel later changed its name to the Queen's Royal Hotel. This wonderful hotel became the victim of a rollercoaster economy based on tourism. Advancements in roads and cars led to the demise of the Queen's Royal in 1927. The building was demolished in 1930. An advertisement from 1893 states, ""The rooms of the Queen's Royal are high and well ventilated, the corridors, parlours and drawing-rooms are spacious [and] handsomely furnished. In the evening the whole is lit up by electricity. A flight of steps leads down to the private dock of the hotel, whereat the little pleasure steamers call, and in front of which is the anchorage of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club, the largest on fresh waters.""",0,0,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/0C88F04B-10D5-4E5B-9EFB-464480918270,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/032/thumbs/93063.jpg

970.724.1(A&B),Caddy:Tea,"The rare art of tea drinking has been celebrated for centuries. Tea was such a valued commodity it was traded as we might trade petroleum today; the term ""under lock and key"" may be applied to give us an idea of how valued this consumable luxury was to our forbearers. In a household of great means the master or mistress would hold a key, as would a senior and trusted member of staff. The ceremony would begin with the caddy being opened to reveal a silver foil lined compartment or compartments and in some cases a crystal mixing bowl. This bowl was used to blend the exotic teas. When the tealeaves were considered to have been well used, or simply spent, the ""slop"" would return to the pantry or kitchens, where it would be stretched by the lesser mortals of the household for a much weaker mug of tea.

It might be said that it is a rare thing to find a tea caddy made of such exotic and valued materials such as tortoise shell, mother of pearl and abalone, fruitwoods, silver, silver-gilt, or even gold. Wouldn't it be even more rare to find an 18th or even 19th century tea caddy made of tooled leather? In the case of this early 19th century tooled leather caddy was once owned by British Army Officer, Dr. Anderson Lowe. It is rare indeed that it has survived in relatively good condition, being of a material prone to disintegration over time. The cylindrical oval-shaped body with hinged cover and foiled interior has a small swing handle finial with a shield-shaped lock escutcheon (formerly silver plated).

970.914.1,Coin,"The Bank of Upper Canada was established in 1821 in York (Toronto) under a charter granted by the Province of Upper Canada in 1819. When Upper and Lower Canada were united to form the Province of Canada, it was decided that only the bank that held the government accounts would have the right to issue copper tokens. This was done so by the Bank of Montreal until 1848. When the Rebellion Losses Bill passed in 1849, there was rioting in Montreal. This led to the destruction of the legislative buildings and the capital of the province was moved to Toronto. As a result the Bank of Upper Canada now produced the tokens.

Between 1850 and 1857 the Bank of Upper Canada issued a series of penny and halfpenny copper tokens. The obverse of this half-penny token, issued in 1852, features a St. George and the dragon motif encircled by the legend BANK OF UPPER CANADA and the date, 1852.

This artefact was donated by the family of Martin McClellan and the following is a description of the course of events by the family. Martin McClellan visited her in Virgil and provided his wife with his watch and this pocketbook. He told his wife that he would never see her or their children again. For 5 days, McClellan could see what the rest of the British garrison in Niagara could see. Across the Niagara River, thousands of American troops on parade around Fort Niagara, workers preparing batteries and boats and 17 armed vessels returning triumphantly from the burning of York. McClellan and the small garrison in Niagara would be no match.
As fog lifted at daybreak the following day, McClellan would see 16 ships, 134 boats and scows (each with 30 - 50 American soldiers) two miles from the Town of Niagara. By 9 o'clock, some 2,300 American soldiers started the land assault under the cover of heavy artillery. The British defence was approximately 567 men, both regulars and militia. It took several attempts for the Americans to assemble on a plain at the western end of the town.
McClellan was in line with the rest of his company facing the U.S. forces a mere 5 - 10 meters away. The two sides fought for over 15 minutes. In the end, the British were forced to retreat, leaving 300 dead or wounded soldiers lying in the field. Martin McClellan was one of them. He died in defence of his country, his home and his family.

Ryerson begin his practice in 1880 and soon established himself as a leading oculist. That year he was appointed professor of eye, ear, and throat diseases at Trinity Medical School, launching a teaching career which would continue until 1918. Also in 1880 he became surgeon at the Andrew Mercer Eye and Ear Infirmary in the Toronto General Hospital. Ryerson was responsible for a number of innovations in Canadian medicine such as a recognition of the perils of colour blindness. Nevertheless he regretted ""that with the fine training I had had in Europe I did not do any original work in my profession.""
When he retired from the medical profession in 1920 he was an affluent man and he withdrew to a large estate, Peaceacres, in Niagara-on-the-Lake. There he wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1924, appropriately by Ryerson Press, as Looking backward. Having returned to Toronto to live, he died there the next year of a heart attack following a brief illness.

In his declining years George lived at ""Locust Grove"" in Niagara-on-the-Lake. The breeches were fashioned from camel coloured wool felt and feature pewter and brass buttons on the legs and cuffs. The breeches also have a brown triangular shaped piece on the back of the waistband. Though the colour is faded, more protected areas reveal the original rich hue. Wear marks on the breeches are absent. There is also a fall front of 8"" wide, 2 suspender buttons on the front and back, buttons and buttonholes at the knee and a buttonhole for a knee buckle. The 1810's style breeches were more fitted and the length extended to the knee where stockings or high boots covered the lower leg. Metal buttons fastened the drop front and would have held suspenders. Large pockets on either side appear to have a wing detail because of a two inch extension of the pocket above its outside seam. One small pocket on the front right side presumably housed a watch. Buttons are reinforced and the inner waist band measuring 34""is lined with linen. The shorter jacket front of this period dictated a higher waistline and drop front to cover the fly.

The bodice is cut to look like a jacket and features fringe trim along the yoke, edges of the sleeves and bottom of the bodice. Fringe was highly fashionable, so much to that the Illustrated London News said that ""fringe may be said to be the most becoming of all trimmings on a lady's dress; it seems to possess the power of imparting lightness and suppleness to the movements of the wearer"". The skirt is domed shaped with rows of tiered flouncing, another very popular trimming, and was worn with a crinoline under it to give it the fullness of the period. The flounces helped to make skirts look wider and would have helped to distribute the weight of the heavy skirt over the crinoline.",1855,1855,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/607DFDD8-3D35-48F0-A898-860019486224,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/055/thumbs/97276(a_b).jpg
972.902 (A),Uniform:Coat,"This uniform coatee was worn by Colonel Daniel McDougal when he was an Ensign at the Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The design is for a Junior officer (ensign or lieutenant) of the Volunteer Incorporated Militia Battalion. It is double breasted with an open stand up collar with a thin black lace trim. The cuffs and collar are dark blue with a short turned up tail. It is lined with white linen and the inside lapels are black. The buttons are reproduction brass. McDougal was born in Inverness, Scotland, in 1782 and came to Canada with his parents who settled in Glengarry County.  When the war broke out in June 1812, he was in the Glengarry Militia and took part in the capture of Ogdensburg on 22 February 1813.  On 20 March he obtained an ensign's commission in the Battalion of Upper Canada Incorporated Militia.  He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 30 March and is said to have been at Fort George on 27 May when it was taken by the Americans and later at Twelve Mile Creek.  He was severely wounded at Lundy's Lane and lying in the field after having been struck seven times, he was initially reported to be ""mortally wounded"".  Although he recovered, McDougal had subsequent health problems as well as a lead ball in his body for the rest of his days.  He nevertheless lived a long and active life. McDougal's coatee respects Governor Simcoe's 1794 instructions, that is scarlet with blue ""facings"" (i.e. the collar, cuffs and lapels) trimmed with ""plain gilt metal buttons"".  To denote his lieutenant's rank, Daniel McDougal wore a gold epaulette with thin gold fringes on the right shoulder only.  On 1 June1814, a gold lace edging was ordered added to cuffs and collars on the officers' coatees of the Upper Canada Militia.  Thus Lieutenant McDougal's coat was most likely made locally between the date of his first commission, in March 1813 and before the summer of 1814.  Being in the field at the time, adding gold edging lace at the collar and cuffs was not an urgent matter for many officers and Lieutenant McDougal's coatee remained plain.  The cuffs, quite small and without buttons, are the only exception to this otherwise regulation coatee. When the coatee, now in possession of the museum, was donated a century ago, it was said to be the one that Lieutenant McDougal wore when he was wounded during the Battle of Lundy's Lane.  McDougal was in no shape to resume his duties for many months.  He was granted a small pension on account of his many wounds.  So the coatee, apart from its cuffs, remained much the same as when he wore it in the field. Garments with such a history are rare, even more so if made in Canada and are fitting reminders of the sacrifices made by our forebears to keep our country free.",1812,1812,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/992A178F-5448-49E8-86D2-342328861612,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/012/thumbs/972902-8.jpg
972.904.1,Uniform:Coat,"Following the War of 1812, Niagara remained a hotbed of military activity. There was concern about republican ideas spreading into Canada and the McKenzie rebellion of 1837 prompted an increased military presence to combat these threats. The 1st King's Dragoon Guards regiment was called from England to help put down the McKenzie uprising and they arrived in Niagara in 1838. A heavy cavalry regiment, The King's Dragoon Guards were renowned for their skill on horseback and their attractive uniforms generated great interest among the citizens in the Niagara area. One recalled the regiment as ""perhaps the finest military body that ever came to the districtâ€¦ officered by men of wealth and title. The men were all six feet in height with fine well-trained horses.""This uniform belonged to one of these imposing men, Sergeant-Major Adam Flanigan. Flanigan was born in 1810 in Ballymena, North Ireland and joined his regiment in Canada in 1840. One of the tasks given to the regiment was the renovation of Fort Mississauga, which probably meant updating its defensive capabilities. While stationed in Niagara, Sergeant-Major Flanigan met and married Agnes Richardson and they settled down to raise a family on Johnson Street in town (Niagara-on-the-Lake). Adam and Agnes were well-known in the local community and had a son William -who died in infancy- and two daughters, Mary and Isabella. At some point in the 1850's Adam broke his hip and was never able to walk again. The Reverend Thomas Creen, rector of St. Mark's Church frequently visited the disabled veteran for company and probably also to administer Church services. Adam died at age 52 and was buried September 16, 1862 in St. Mark's Churchyard in Niagara-on-the-Lake.  His uniform jacket, along with his helmet and other accoutrements were donated to the local museum and serve as a striking reminder of the extensive military tradition in the Niagara region.",1825,1840,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/02E30710-8974-43C4-B3B0-725319201814,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/029/thumbs/9729041.jpg

The home built on the property was burnt down in 1813 but was rebuilt sometime before the 1820s.  John Breckenridge purchased it in 1822 and then in 1826 it was purchased by innkeeper David Bodsford which began its history as an Inn.  The building was also used by officers of the Niagara Harbor and Dock Company (Philip Delatre in 1832 and Robert Melville in 1843).  In 1846 the building was purchased by Richard Howard, former owner of the Angel Inn. Although the building looks small there was a long frame wing out in behind.  The hotel was apparently named Promenade house due to the habits of its clientele - sundry ladies of the night. It is also believed that the building was used as a grammar school for a time and as a residence for some  Polish Officers during the First World War.

It is made of embroidered net and has a pink taffeta cummerbund.  It was a party dress to be worn in the afternoons and evenings, but was not a ball gown.  The Rand family was quite prominent in Town.  My personal recollection of the family is their horse-drawn carriage, which took them to St. Mark's Church for Sunday service, driving past my house on King Street.  I also remember that the Rands always had a July 4th celebration, to which townspeople were invited and which I attended several times.There were four Rand children, two of them girls.  I remember them dressed in these short dresses towards the end of the 1920s, which was the Flapper Era.The Rands were one of the many Americans who summered in Niagara-on-the-Lake.  One of the highlights of the summer season was the fireworks display that Mr. George Rand put on every July 4th.

981.61.1,Typewriter,"A black standard typewriter by Underwood.

""By 1896 many components, combinations and designs had been tried and the winner was emerging; a typewriter that was fast and wonderful to type on, a typewriter that would usher in the new century, conquer the world, and put an end to this period of rich diversity in typewriter history. The Underwood had arrived.
The Underwood typewriter was the first widely successful modern typewriter. It pulled together the three main design elements that would be found on all later machines, a four-row straight keyboard, front striking type-bars (giving visible typing) and one shift key. The Underwood was not the first to offer these essential features, the Daugherty was in 1893, but it was by far the best engineered machine to have done so by 1896.
Franz Wagner, a brilliant engineer who was involved with the Caligraph and other pioneering typewriters, sold his invention to the John Underwood & Co., a major supplier of typewriter ribbons. The first model, shown above, still maintained Wagner's name stenciled onto the back of the frame.
The Underwood model 5 remained in production from 1900 to the early 1930's, making it the ""Singer Sewing machine of typewriters"".
Over the next ten years, just about all of the under-strike (blind-writers) and index typewriters would be dropped from the market. The Wild West of typewriters was over.""

982.1.37(A),Sword,"This is an officer's sword that has the inscription ""Capt'n Daniel Servos, Butler's Rangers 1778"" on its scabbard. The hilt is silver and green with an eagle on the pommel.  The sword was donated to the Museum by William Kirby, who married into the Servos family. Servos is said to have used the sword when he was in the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812 and during the Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837-38.  Family legend states that the sword belonged to Colonel Johnson who was killed at the siege of Fort Niagara in 1759.  Overall, the sword looks like a type of ""hunting sword"" or large dirk or hanger.  The design evolved from a European style that probably developed in Germany, for boar hunting.  Straight or curved short blades (under 27 inches) are most typical.  Sometimes older broadsword blades were cut down and re-used. The blade in this case looks to have lots of wear and early marks.  Hunting swords of this type became very popular amongst officers as a personal weapon.  The eagle pommel indicates that the sword is probably American.  The grip is green dyed shagreen (ray or shark skin), which was extremely fashionable in the 18th century.  The metal cross banding is also typical of this early period.

982.1.37(B),Scabbard,"This black leather scabbard with a brass tip, which is unfortunately broken in two places, has the inscription ""CaptÕn Daniel Servos, ButlerÕs Rangers 1778"". The scabbard is in broken two places. Along with the sword associated with it, the scabbard was donated to the Museum by William Kirby, who married into the Servos family. Servos is said to have used the sword when he was in the 1st Regiment of the Lincoln Militia during the War of 1812 and during the Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837-38.Ê Family legend states that the sword belonged to Colonel Johnson who was killed at the siege of Fort Niagara in 1759.Ê Overall, the sword looks like a type of ""hunting sword"" or large dirk or hanger.Ê The design evolved from a European style that probably developed in Germany, for boar hunting.Ê Straight or curved short blades (under 27 inches) are most typical.Ê Sometimes older broadsword blades were cut down and re-used. The blade in this case looks to have lots of wear and early marks.Ê Hunting swords of this type became very popular amongst officers as a personal weapon.Ê The eagle pommel on the sword indicates that it is probably American.Ê The grip is green dyed shagreen (ray or shark skin), which was extremely fashionable in the 18th century.Ê The metal cross banding is also typical of this early period.Ê The chain hand guard was quite common in the 1770's and 1780's.

Used when Gov. Simcoe received E.A. and F.C. 7th Dec. 1773, and M.M 18th Jan. 1774.""From ""Proceedings: Grand Lodge of A.F. & A.M. of Canada, 1908"" There is a section that talks about this gavel, titled, ""Historic Gavel"" it reads, At the request of the Grand Master, M. W. Bro. J. Ross Robertson, Historian of the Grand Lodge, gave the following history of the gavel with which Grand Lodge was opened : ""The gavel which the M. W. the Grand Master has just used to open Grand Lodge has some historic value, and is of special interest to you, my brethren, at this the meeting of Grand Lodge held in the old Niagara district. A hundred and sixteen years ago Gen. John Graves Simcoe inaugurated the first government of the Province of Upper Canada at the old town of Niagara, fourteen miles from where we now meet. He came from Exeter, in Devon. England and this gavel was that used on the night of his initiation and passing in Union Lodge, Exeter, in December. 1773. and at his raising in January, 1774. Little did Bro. Simcoe think, when he resided at the old town of Niagara, that 116 years later the gavel that was used when he was made a Mason would be used again at a Grand Lodge in his old province, at which 800 of the brethren attended. It was always a tradition that Gen. Simcoe was a Mason, but proof was not available. With the assistance of Bro. W. J. Hughan, the distinguished Masonic historian I found an old record of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Devon showing Simcoe's initiation. It was a small printed book, picked out of a thousand that were for sale in a large library. This was ten years ago. Then I searched for the minutes of Union Lodge, and last year, after being hidden away in a deed box in a bank vault in Exeter for over eighty years, these records were found intact. The records were complete. Then three months ago the proprietor of the ancient Globe Tavern in the cathedral yard found the old desk of Union Lodge in the attic of the old hotel, and on opening it found this gavel, which was, beyond doubt, that used in Union Lodge."" Another passage on the gavel from the ""Encyclopedia of Freemasonry"" by Albert G. Mackey M.D. talks about the 'interlacing triangles' that is the symbol found on this gavel. ""The interlacing triangles or deltas symbolize the union of the two principles or forces, the active and passive, male and female, pervading the universe ... The two triangles, one white and the other black, interlacing, typify the mingling of apparent opposites in nature, darkness and light, error and truth, ignorance and wisdom, evil and good, throughout human life."" The letters stand for the 3 basic degrees in ""craft masonry"".E.A. = entered apprentice, F.C. = fellow craft, M.M. = master mason.",0,0,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/04E5FC75-86F8-425D-B00B-461543327238,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/038/thumbs/98611.jpg

986.1.523,Plaque:Metal,"In Upper Canada during the early nineteenth century metal plaques were provided by fire insurance companies to homeowners who had purchased insurance coverage.  The sample plaque in the Museum's collection is oval in shape with dimensions of 14 cm high x 18 cm wide.  It depicts two hands shaking at the top centre above the date 1836, followed by the words ""Niagara District Mutual Fire Insurance Co.""  The plaque is made of iron and is faded green, yellow, brown and black in colour.Open fires were an essential part of living in those days, used for heating in winter and cooking throughout the year.  But with many fires often unprotected and unguarded, and many houses made almost entirely of wood, serious fires were quite common and often devastating.  The intention was that the homeowner displayed the plaque on the outside of his house so that fire fighters, arriving to extinguish the fire, would see the plaque and know that they would be paid by the insurance company upon successful completion of their job.  It is said that fire brigades would sometimes refuse to put out a fire if there was no immediate evidence of fire insurance on the property.Indeed, fire was so ever-present and potentially catastrophic at that time that it became common for many insurance companies to own and operate their own fire brigades until that responsibility was passed over to local government in 1866.  In Niagara-on-the-Lake there is one known fire insurance plaque on a house dating from those times.  It is at The Whale Inn, adjacent to the Niagara river at the junction of King and Delater streets.

The founding members were three close friends who all lived in Niagara-on-the-Lake. They used the first letter in their last names to create the RJR logo. Dr. Bruce Rigg was a local physician who used his knowledge of chemistry to formulate some of the early coloured glazes. He also prepared the raw clay for shaping and firing, turned plates and bowls on a potters wheel, and decorated many of the pottery pieces. Mary Jones was the wife of a retired banker. She was a talented artist who decorated many of the plates with scenes of local churches, old buildings, historic sites and other local points of interest. Bill Richardson operated a local coal business. For the pottery he dug the local clay from the dock area in Queenston. Located in his coal yard was a oil-fired kiln that was used to fire the early pottery pieces. This kiln was later replaced by an electric kiln located in the coal yard, then in 1956 it was moved to the pottery. In 1956 Bill Richardson moved out of town and the RJR logo was replaced by B+B, for Bruce and Betty Rigg.

After his death on October 13, 1812, during the Battle of Queenston Heights, he was buried at his first resting place at one of the bastions at Fort George. But it was decided the ""hero"" of Upper Canada deserved a more suitable memorial, and in 1824, he, along with his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell, were buried beneath the monument in October of 1824.  The vault beneath the monument was not going to be his final resting place.On April 17, 1840, the monument was damaged by a gunpowder bomb. It is believed that Irish-Canadian, Benjamin Lett, who was involved in William Lyon Mackenzie's 1837 Rebellion, was the culprit. The remains of Brock were moved to the Hamilton family cemetery on the grounds of Willowbank in Queenston, until they could reinterred under a new monument on October 13, 1853.",1824,1824,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/56A2209A-1B4C-45D0-9D51-281097281688,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/056/thumbs/9885158-6.jpg

The Committee are anticipating a large party, and are making every necessary arrangement for their comfort and accommodation; the Boat has splendid cabins and promenaces, and will be tastefully decorated with evergreens and appropriate banners. Refreshments will be sold on board the boat to those who may call for them.
No person admitted on board without a ticket, and in order to prevent confusion and delay, parties are requested to provide themselves with tickets previous to the boat calling at the different places of embarking.
It is particularly desired that the company be at the boat earlier than the house mentioned, as it will leave precisely at the time specified.

988.5.208,Poster,"A blank schedule for the Erie & Ontario Railway which is dated between 1854 and 1857. The construction of the Erie & Ontario Railway began in 1835 and wasn't completed until 1841.The railway cars were drawn by a team of horses, on tracks that were made of wooden rails topped with iron. This was the first operational railroad in Upper Canada, and it ran (before it was completed) between Chippawa and Niagara Falls in 1838 and was likely operational into Queenston in 1839. In 1854, the rail line was taken over by Samuel Zimmerman and this is when the horse drawn operation ended and the rail cards were replaced with steam engines. The railway was also extended to Niagara (Niagara-on-the-Lake) bypassing Queenston. Following the death of Zimmerman in 1857 the Erie & Ontario underwent a few changes, including its purchase in 1863. It would be now known as the Erie and Niagara Railway, and in 1878 the Michigan Central Railroad assumed its operation in 1894 and then the New York Central Railroad in 1929.

993.542.147,Medal,"After the Civil War, a body of Irish-American veterans sought to obtain Irish independence from Great Britain, and believed that by capturing Canada, they could achieve this. Known as the Fenian Brotherhood, these radicals conducted raids into Canadian territory from 1866 to 1871 and although they had initial success, it would prove short lived. The movement ended in failure and was over by 1871. The only Fenian victory was the initial assault at Ridgeway in 1866, all subsequent actions were failures. Large bodies of British troops and Canadian militia defended the Canadian border and stopped the Fenians before they could gain a foothold in Canada.John Raynor of Niagara-on-the-Lake was one of the many Canadian veterans who were awarded this medal for service in 1870. Raynor had initially volunteered under the 1854 Canadian Militia Act and served in the army after the Trent Affair, when an American vessel captured Confederate diplomats from a British mail packet, creating severe tension between Britain and America during the Civil War. The Trent Affair encouraged Britain to increase the military presence in Canadian territory.

Unlike the traditional ball, the Minie Ball expanded within the barrel of the musket in which it was fired, allowing them to take advantage of rifling that conventional musket balls could not.

FA69.1119,Mask:Gas,"The First World War is an arresting demonstration of the conflict between traditional tactics and new technology. Commanders ordered soldiers to dig trenches to hold ground, and charge the enemy head on in order to advance. Facing newly developed machine guns, fighter planes and tanks, this policy led to an unprecedented number of casualties for both sides. In the spring of 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, allied soldiers would be introduced to yet another technological development: Chlorine Gas. At 5:00PM on April 22nd 1915, German troops released Chlorine gas on the French 45th Algerian Division, positioned to the left of the Canadian line at Ypres. While most of the gas missed the Canadians, the French retreat created a large gap in the defensive line that had to be filled by the outnumbered Canadians. Fighting to hold the position, the Canadians faced a direct Chlorine Gas attack two days later. Though the Canadians were able to hold the position until reinforcements arrived, the battle cost the lives of 6,000 Canadians in their first major engagement of the war. It was in this environment that the first gas masks were produced.The threat of poison gas remained, and different methods of protecting soldiers from Chemical warfare were developed. Featured here is a German Lederschutzmaske from 1917. It is composed of an all-leather face piece, glass lenses, and rubber and cloth straps which run along the back to ensure a secure fit. The chemical filter is directly attached, differentiating it from the Allied 'small box respirator' style of mask in which the filter was carried in a satchel, worn on the back and away from the face.  The German design made the mask less cumbersome, but it was known to reduce the soldier's ability to fire his weapon accurately.  Respirators on the mask were also known to wear out faster than their Allied counterparts, and the leather sections, used due to economic shortages, often failed under high concentrations of gas.     Although details of this mask's journey are unknown, it is likely that it made its way to Canada as part of a collection of war souvenirs. Trophies of the conflict were in great demand, with soldiers searching for weapons, clothing and equipment, to bring back as mementos of their actions overseas. Nearly 100 years later, souvenirs such as this one still serve as solemn reminders of the sacrifices that were made and of the challenges that Canadian soldiers faced during the conflict.",1916,1918,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/11B1544A-D81C-4AD0-8D7D-974228514821,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/035/thumbs/fa691119.jpg

FA69.3.194,Cabinet:Filing,"Featured in ""100 Years, 100 Artefacts"" Dr. Richard Merritt describes the box as, ""A utilitarian object of impeccable local provenance, superb craftsmanship in original condition - what more could one ask for?This walnut box, 30 cm in height arrived at the museum in 1980 as part of the Servos Collection transferred from Parks Canada, having been obtained from the last member of the Servos Family at Palatine Hill on the Four Mile Creek.This late 17th - early 18th century box was designed to hold and conceal valuable papers/documents, perhaps a small Bible, coins, medals, jewellery, miniature family portraits and other treasured keepsakes - now long forgotten.The square-domed lid of the box contains a secret compartment.  Below, the front opens by a concealed peg revealing 2 rows of small drawers, behind one of which is a smaller hidden compartment.  The hand-forged iron lock and escutcheon plus hinges are fastened with early rose-headed nails.The Servos family was living during the late 1600s in the German Palatinate where it is thought the box originated.  The patriarch of the North American family arrived in the Province of New York on the Charlotte River in 1726 with a letter of introduction, probably kept in the box.During the American Revolution, four Servos brothers remained loyal to the Crown with 2 brothers, Captain Daniel and Lieutenant Jacob serving with the British Indian Department.  They and their families arrived at Niagara as refuges in the early 1780s with only a few possessions, including the box.  Daniel operated grist and sawmills as well as a general store on the Four Mile Creek where he erected his home, Palatine Hill, the earliest surviving house in Niagara until it burned in 1950's.

FA69.3.266,Sampler,"Young girls were expected to grow up, get married, have children and care for their family home. These expectations meant that girls often received a very different education then boys. Girls were often taught only arithmetic or reading-if their parents could afford to pay for their schooling-along with other skills that were considered to be ""female accomplishments"". This included manners, sewing, painting, music and comportment. Samplers are therefore the most tangible evidence of female education during the early years of Niagara history. To prepare a young girl for the responsibility of sewing for her future family, girls completed at least two samplers. The first, called a marking sampler, was completed when a girl was around 5 or 6 (sometimes older) and served two purposes: to teach basic embroidery and numbers and the alphabet. A wonderful example of a marking sampler within our collection is this one made by Mary Miller Ball at the age of 8 years. If you take a close look at Mary Miller's sampler, what designs catch the eye? Letters or birds? Anything else? While it is not the most visually appealing or even the best quality in terms of skill, what one should notice is how the alphabet repeats on Mary's sampler. I am sure that many people can remember practicing their own handwriting skills in elementary school by writing the letters of the alphabet over and over again. On this sampler Mary embroidered the alphabet twice to show she had learned it. The sewing skills and education that Mary learned via this sampler would have no doubt benefited her later in her life. After marrying into the Servos family, and divorcing her husband, Mary ended up raising her 4 children at the Four Mile Creek Mills. She also managed the family business, kept meticulous records, managed all of her own affairs, lived on her own means and owned all the stock and chattels on the farm. The sampler provided her with a means of practicing literacy and numbers, skills greatly needed to manage a business.",0,0,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/08A7EFC8-A572-43F2-98E5-013824654031,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/024/thumbs/fa693266-2.jpg

FA69.3.42,Cup,"A horn drinking cup which once belonged to the Servos family. On close examination this beaker proved to be of turned wood, well polished to emulate horn, with an inset wood base. It is lined with sterling silver, the rim bearing a scalloped pattern. This rim bears hallmarks which indicate that it was manufactured by the firm of George Ashforth and Company of Sheffield, England between 1773 and 1783.
The origin of the cup and where and how the silver lining was added is a mystery. Ashforth was mainly known for the manufacture of such items as tea and coffee pots, candlesticks and salt cellars; so it is strange to find a beaker lined with their silver. One conjecture might be that the lining was part of a flat silver piece, while the rim was adapted from a small item such as a salt cellar.
Since the Loyalist Servos brothers came to Niagara from Schoharie, New York in 1778, it may be assumed that the cup came into their possession after the American Revolution. Whether it was before they moved to Ontario is unknown. It is purported to have belonged to Jacob Servos who settled north of the present Lakeshore Road.",0,0,https://niagarahistorical.pastperfectonline.com/Webobject/7094F876-55B4-4B94-B17C-297963261768,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pastperfectonline/images/museum_74/034/thumbs/fa69342.jpg

He was a major railway builder and built a railway from Balaclava to Sebastopol to carry supplies during the Crimean War. It is possible that 'C. Camidge' was working for Peto's firm in Niagara during the construction of the early railways. It is believed that this is Charles Camidge who worked for the Peto firm as paymaster and came to Canada to assist with railroad development. He settled in Niagara, taught at a local school (see Janet Carnochan's History of Niagara). Camidge was accused of harming a young girl from Maria Rye's school for British girls called ""Our Western Home"" and went to trial in St. Catharines.

The rare art of tea drinking has been celebrated for centuries.
